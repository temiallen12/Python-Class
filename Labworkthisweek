#Answer to lab 1

# List of 10 numbers
# numbers = [3, 7, 1, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8, 5, 10]

# sum variable
# sum_total = 0

# Repeat through the list and add each number to the sum_total
# for num in numbers:
    # sum_total += num

# then print the result
# print("The adding of the numbers is:", sum_total)


# Answer to lab work 2
# secret_number = 7  
# guesses = 0

# print("Guess the secret number (between 1 and 10). You have 5 tries!")

# while guesses < 5:
#    guess = int(input("Your guess: "))
 #   guesses += 1

   # if guess == secret_number:
   #     print("You guessed it right! You win!")
      #  break
 #   else:
     #   print("Wrong guess.")

# if guess != secret_number:
 #   print("Sorry, you lost. The secret number was", secret_number)

# Answer to lab 3
# Asking for number till you enter negative 
# total = 0

# while True:
   # number = int(input("Enter a number (negative to stop): "))
  #  if number < 0:
      #  break
  #  total += number

# print("The sum of all entered numbers is:", total)

# Ask for name until the users enter end 
# while True:
  #  name = input("Enter a name (type END to stop): ")
  #  if name == "END":
      #  break
   # print("You entered:", name)

# print("I am done.")
# program to find the multiples of n
# n = int(input("Enter a number to find its multiples: "))

# for i in range(1, 11):
  #  print(f"{n} x {i} = {n * i}")
